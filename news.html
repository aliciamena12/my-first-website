                            <b>Summary: </b>HITMAN 3 is the dramatic conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy and takes players around the world on a globetrotting adventure to sprawling sandbox locations. Every mission location in HITMAN 3 is meticulously detailed and packed full of creative opportunities. Players will have unrivalled freedom to complete their objectives and the game world will react to everything they do.<br>
                            Agent 47 returns as a ruthless professional for the most important contracts of his entire career. Supported by his Agency handler, Diana Burnwood, 47 joins forces with his long-lost friend Lucas Grey. Their ultimate mission is to eliminate the partners of Providence, but they are forced to adapt as their hunt intensifies. When the dust settles, 47 and the world he inhabits will never be the same again.<br>
                            The World of Assassination trilogy is fully realised with HITMAN 3 as the ultimate place to play all three games. It will be possible to 'import' owned locations, unlocks and progression from the previous two HITMAN games, essentially putting all 20+ locations from the entire trilogy in one place.
